# About

YouTube Timer is a plugin that allows you to set a daily limit on your YouTube (tm) usage.

# Features
---

* An adjustable daily time limit that only counts down on a YouTube page.
* Automatic page blocking after your time runs out
* Automatic video pausing when you change tabs or windows (no cheating now!)
* A nice big timer you can open in a seperate window
* Parental controls that prevent your kids from changing the settings (perfect if you install this on their devices!)

# Bug report

(By L. Roberto)
1. Timer randomly stops counting
2. Display stops counting but clock keeps ticking
3. Random glitches -- YouTube is blocked for no reason.
